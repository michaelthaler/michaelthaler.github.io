I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at University College London. I am also an Affiliate at CEPR, an Affiliate at CESifo, and an Associate Editor of the Journal of the European Economic Association. I received my PhD from Harvard University and completed my postdoc at Princeton University.

My research is in behavioral economics, experimental economics, and political economy. I am particularly interested in belief updating, communication, and political polarization.

See my [CV](/cv/) and [Google Scholar page]({{ site.author.googlescholar }}) for more information.
